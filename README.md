## CoinMarketCap-Categories
Analysis Crypto Groups by Market Capitalization.
It's my personal script for my own usage, it doesn't have any comments, because for me the picture is cleare from visualization.
It has 2 illustrations:
- all portfolios 
- excluding expensive portfolios and ecosystem (in order to see perspective categories)

As a trader, I wanted to see where and how the money are distributed in USD among different portfolios and coin groups.
